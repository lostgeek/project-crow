# Website for Project CROW
Welcome to Project CROW, a series of mini-campaigns for Netrunner aiming to provide an introductory experience for beginners, who have played [System Gateway](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-gateway/) and [System Update 2021](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-update-2021/) by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/).
They consist of a number of duel decks starting at the initial card pool of System Gateway and System Update 2021, sometimes adding in a few key cards from the larger Standard card pool, and then advancing over multiple stages to finally end at top-level competitive Standard decks played at current tournaments of its time.

The website can be found [here](https://crow.lostgeek.de/)!
