# Jump into the Standard format!
Welcome to Project CROW, a series of mini-campaigns for Netrunner aiming to provide an introductory experience for beginners, who have played [System Gateway](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-gateway/) and [System Update 2021](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-update-2021/) by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/).
They consist of a number of duel decks starting at the initial card pool of System Gateway and System Update 2021, sometimes adding in a few key cards from the larger Standard card pool, and then advancing over multiple stages to finally end at top-level competitive Standard decks played at current tournaments of its time.
Currently there are five iterations:
 * [CROW 1](/decks/crow-1) - 2019 Regionals  - :Card{name="Valencia Estevez"} vs :Card{name="Controlling the Message" fullname="true"}
 * [CROW 2](/decks/crow-2) - 2019 World Championship - :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan"} vs :Card{name="P훮lan훮 Foods" text="Jinteki: P훮lan훮 Foods"}
 * [CROW 3](/decks/crow-3) - 2020 German Nationals - multiple matchups
   * :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan"} vs :Card{name="Replicating Perfection" fullname="true"}
   * :Card{name="Hoshiko Shiro"} vs :Card{name="Argus Security" text="Weyland: Argus Security"}
   * :Card{name="419"} vs :Card{name="Asa Group" text="HB: Asa Group"}
 * [CROW 4](/decks/crow-4) - 2021 System Gateway release - :Card{name="MaxX"} vs :Card{name="Precision Design" fullname="true"}
