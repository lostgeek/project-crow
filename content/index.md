# Jump into the Standard format!
Welcome to Project CROW, a series of mini-campaigns aiming to provide an introductory experience for beginners, who have played [System Gateway](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-gateway/) and [System Update 2021](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-update-2021/) by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/).
They consist of a number of duel decks starting at the initial card pool of System Gateway and System Update 2021, sometimes adding in a few key cards from the larger Standard card pool, and then advancing over multiple stages to finally end at top-level competitive Standard decks played at current tournaments of its time.
Currently there are five iterations:
## CROW 1
Example 1: :Card{name="Reina Roja" text="Reina Roja"}
Example 2: :Card{name="City Surveillance"}
