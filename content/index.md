# Jump into the Standard format!
Welcome to Project CROW, a series of mini-campaigns for Netrunner aiming to provide an introductory experience for beginners, who have played [System Gateway](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-gateway/) and [System Update 2021](https://nullsignal.games/products/system-update-2021/) by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/).
They consist of a number of duel decks starting at the initial card pool of System Gateway and System Update 2021, sometimes adding in a few key cards from the larger Standard card pool, and then advancing over multiple stages to finally end at top-level competitive Standard decks played at current tournaments of its time.
Currently there are five iterations:
 * [CROW 1](/decks/crow-1) &ndash; 2019 Regionals - :Card{name="Valencia Estevez"} vs :Card{name="Controlling the Message" fullname="true"}
 * [CROW 2](/decks/crow-2) &ndash; 2019 World Championship &ndash; :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan"} vs :Card{name="P훮lan훮 Foods" text="Jinteki: P훮lan훮 Foods"}
 * [CROW 3](/decks/crow-3) &ndash; 2020 German Nationals &ndash; multiple matchups
   * :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan"} vs :Card{name="Replicating Perfection" fullname="true"}
   * :Card{name="Hoshiko Shiro"} vs :Card{name="Argus Security" text="Weyland: Argus Security"}
   * :Card{name="419"} vs :Card{name="Asa Group" text="HB: Asa Group"}
 * [CROW 4](/decks/crow-4) &ndash; 2021 System Gateway release &ndash; :Card{name="MaxX"} vs :Card{name="Precision Design" fullname="true"}

The first iteration of Project CROW centered around the Valencia vs Controlling the Message matchup.
That particular Corp was infamous for being loved by a lot of high-level players, while being often hated by the wider community for its interactions based around the card Hard-Hitting News.
Often other decks used the tags from that card to immediately kill the Runner through cards like BOOM!, whereas CtM tended to use tags "non-binarily" and have more nuanced play patterns.
This lead to the well-known meme below:

Project CROW was named after this meme and was an attempt to introduce these nuances to beginners and intermediate players in a four-stage mini-campaign starting at Reina Roja vs NBN: Making News and ending with the Valencia and CtM decks of its time.
