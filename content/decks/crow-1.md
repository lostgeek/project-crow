# Stage 1

Coming out of the SC19 meta, one of the central cards that is introduced in this step is :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"} (HHN in short). This is the central card in the matchup and what the whole game will revolve around.

Let's take it apart: HHN only triggers if a run has been made in the previous turn, so the Runner controls this part of the card. This means as the Runner try to only run if you've got sufficient money or know for sure they do not have a HHN in hand. For what amount of money the Runner should have, there are two limits. If they are above 8c, they can in any case remove all 4 tags the card gives them. Since the card is a terminal, the Corp cannot use the fact that the Runner is tagged until their next turn, so if you can clear all 4 tags, you're fine. This may still leave the Runner behind broken economically. The second level is if the Runner has a similar or larger credit total than the Corp. Since the card costs 3 to play, is a trace\[4\], the Runner has 1 link, and Making News typically has 2 recurring credits, the Runner cannot get hit, if they have 2 more credits than the Corp. Even if only a few credits shy, it rarely is advantageous for the Corp to go down to 0 credits just to land those 4 tags, if the Runner is able to remove them next turn anyways.

Another new card is :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"}, which is a good tempo card for the Corp. They will typically install it in the scoring remote and it draws them cards and gives them credits to boost them in their game plan.

Your game plan is to build a scoring remote together with :Card{name="Ash 2X3ZB9CY"} and :Card{name="Red Herrings"}, while making centrals (especially R&D) a hassle to run with :Card{name="Data Raven" text="Data Ravens"} and :Card{name="Hunter" text="Hunters"}. Install :Card{name="Daily Business Show"} and :Card{name="PAD Campaign" text="PAD Campaigns"} out in the open, to generate drip economy and keep HQ clean. You have the threat of HHN to make trashing your assets unviable. 

If the Runner has to drop low in credits to keep up, you can use HHN to tag them. This might force the Runner to give up the economic war and "go tag-me" (stay tagged). The Reina deck does not neccessarily need its resources and going tag-me has the benefit of making the :Card{name="Data Raven" text="Data Ravens"} and :Card{name="Hunter" text="Hunters"} ineffective. The Runner can now try to win by getting good accesses off of HQ and R&D. If they do not win fast enough, you can use :Card{name="Psychographics"} to score your final points especially together with :Card{name="Project Beale"} for some ridiculously large amounts of agenda points. Keep in mind: a single 13-advanced Project Beale will give you 7 points to win the game.
