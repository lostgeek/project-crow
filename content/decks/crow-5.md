# CROW 5: Trojan-light Arissana vs Tucana Ob
:Toc{}
Welcome to the fifth iteration of the Project CROW mini-campaign for beginners familiar with System Gateway and System Update 2021.
It consists of a set of duel decks that are upgraded over three stages. We start at the first stage mainly with cards from System Gateway + System Update 2021, but introduce a few key cards from the Standard pool (see [here](https://nisei.net/players/supported-formats/) for further information on the tournament formats Startup and Standard).
At stage 2, we open up the card pool to the Startup format, but also add some more necessary Standard cards to teach some further elements.
Stage 3 are the two decks [Frog off, Keeling!](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/08d4235a-1722-4d72-ad36-90bfc3d03211/frog-off-keeling-16th-30th-emea-) and [Calibrating...TUCANA!](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/40bdda01-24cd-4b0c-84b8-f0fc23b2f535/calibrating-tucana-16th-30th-at-2023-nsg-emea-continen#) that `@percomis` and myself brought to the [2023 EMEA Continentals](https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/3779/2023-europe-middle-east-and-africa-continental) placing 16th and 30th respectively (out of a total of 145 players).

## Stage 1

::NrdbDecks

:nrdb_ids: level1
---
#C1
### New cards
We start with a basic :Card{name="Built to Last"} list. Cards from outside the System Gateway + System Update card pool are:

 * :Card{name="Azef Protocol"} - This card enables Weyland to play a 7x 3/2 agenda suite, which lends itself well to a fast-advance plan (i.e. scoring agendas in the same turn you advance them).
 * :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"} - This card is a staple of Standard and accelerates any deck it is played in. Best use is to have this + an end the run ice on turn 1 and just catapult yourself into the game with 3 new cards to use and 3 credits to kick-start your economy.
 * :Card{name="Slash and Burn Agriculture"} + :Card{name="Tree Line"} - The Expendable mechanic in the newest set "The Automata Initiative" makes for some very flexible cards, where you can use them either for their usual card text or for their expendable ability, discarding them in the process. Especially the agenda is interesting, as you can use it to fast-advance your other agendas at the cost of now having 2 points in your Archives ready for the Runner to steal.

### Description
The main feature of this deck is the fast-advance strategy. Put a 3/2 agenda into a remote, advance it once (netting a credit from your ID ability) and then use :Card{name="Trick of Light"} to shift 2 further advancement tokens from some of your advanceable ice to it. Almost all of your agendas are scoreable from hand, with the exception of :Card{name="Slash and Burn Agriculture"}, which acts as a fourth fast-advance tool at the expense of placing 2 points into Archives.

Your game plan is protecting HQ while creating a scoring remote to put :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"} and Agendas into in the early game. Once the Runner is capable of getting into your remote, aim to score the remaining points directly from hand instead. To enable :Card{name="Trick of Light"}, either manually advance your ice or expend :Card{name="Tree Line"} as a more efficient alternative.

#R1
### New cards
We start with a basic :Card{name="Tāo"} list. Cards from outside the System Gateway + System Update card pool are:

 * :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} - The biggest upgrade to Shaper coming from System Gateway + System Update. This tutors your breakers at instant-speed, which means that you can wait to decide which of them you need until the Corp rezzes something that needs taking care of. Combine it with :Card{name="Overclock"} to install your breakers for very cheap!
 * :Card{name="Pichação"} - A fun tool to put on ice in key moments. Combined with :Card{name="Conduit"} and :Card{name="Pantograph"} it can create some very deep R&D digs, where you keep reinstalling Pichação over and over again.
 * :Card{name="Daily Casts"} - A reprint in Ashes of an FFG classic. Basically always worth the install.

### Description
This is a pretty basic Shaper build. Fetch your breakers with :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} when you need them. Make money with your various economy options and break into servers.

Be aware that the Corp is on a fast advance plan and the game might be over quicker than you'd like!

## Stage 2

:nrdb_ids: level2

#C2
### New cards
We now include some more cards from the entirety of Null Signals history (also called the Neo format):

 * :Card{name="Ob Superheavy Logistics"} - First and foremost, your ID is now Ob. This beast of a ship opens up a wide range of options. Whenever you trash one of your installed cards, you can tutor another installable costing one less. We will note possible targets in a separate section later.
 * :Card{name="Audacity"} - We get a bit more careless in favour of fast advance now. Another copy of :Card{name="Slash and Burn Agriculture"} and Audacity means that you often score while throwing points into Archives. But this does not necessarily mean that you are bleeding off points to the Runner. If you score an Azef Protocol, as part of the scoring cost, you can trash a 1-cost card (:Card{name="Ice Wall"} or :Card{name="Vovô Ozetti"}) to fetch a Spin Doctor and install and rez it. This not only fills your hand back up, but also allows you to shuffle back any agendas that you might have trashed during that score.
 * :Card{name="Extract"} - Enables you to use your ID ability very flexibly to fetch whatever is needed right now. The Runner found a :Card{name="Gauss"} and breaks your :Card{name="Ice Wall"} for cheap now? Turn it into a :Card{name="Spin Doctor"} or :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"} and draw for other solutions. 
 * :Card{name="Calibration Testing"} - Already a good card on its own, this shines particularly in Ob. Just install it in the server in some previous turn. If the Runner goes in to trash it, they probably expended resources they would've used on other servers. If they do not, you get to fast advance an agenda from HQ, while also grabbing a 2-cost card on the way (:Card{name="Whitespace"} or :Card{name="Hafrún"}). Keep in mind that you cannot fetch :Card{name="Regolith Mining License"} this way, as your scoring server is still occupied by the Agenda you're just trying to score and you will not have any clicks left to empty the Regolith.
 * :Card{name="Mavirus"} - The Runner is now including a copy of :Card{name="Clot"} in their deck. Watch [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Fr6pI4o7M) by `@Sanjay` on the timing to use this card. In short: Always use your fast advance option last.
  * So you go "install, advance" and then pause or actively ask for "action?" to give the Runner an opportunity to install their Clot via :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} or :Card{name="Simulchip"}. If they do not, you can for example use Audacity and then immediately score before passing back priority to the Runner. This way they cannot install :Card{name="Clot"} in response to your use of Audacity.
  * On the other hand, if they do install Clot and you have :Card{name="Mavirus"} on board, you can still score by using all your fast advance tools to get your agenda to 3 advancement tokens and then rez and use :Card{name="Mavirus"} to get rid of the Clot and score your agenda before passing back priority. Once again, the Runner cannot re-install Clot as you are still holding onto priority here.
 * :Card{name="Envelopment"} - A beefy ice with the downside of having a "Trash this ice" subroutine. While for other IDs this is an actual downside, for :Card{name="Ob Superheavy" text="Ob"}, this just means an opportunity to search for one of your 4-cost ice instead!
 * :Card{name="Sandstone"} - Amazing barrier from the Ashes cycle that gets smaller each time the Runner visits. Keep in mind that purging also gets rid of virus counters on your own cards!
 * :Card{name="Afshar"} - Very efficient code gate to make checking HQ comparatively expensive to the Runner.
 * :Card{name="Hafrún"} + :Card{name="Stavka"} + :Card{name="Winchester"} - Now we get into one of the dirty tricks of the Ob ID ability (that also works in Startup already). When the Runner approaches Stavka or Winchester, you can actually use your ID to fetch :Card{name="Hafrún"} either by trashing a 3-cost card to Stavkas on-rez ability or by using one of your 3-cost upgrades at instant speed. Your ID now installs and rezzes Hafrún, fulfilling its "when rezzed during a run on this server" clause and allowing you to disable one installed breaker of the Runner, likely their Sentry solution. Fire the subroutines and trash their stuff! For this to work, you need to keep track of where your Hafrún is. If you draw it, think about shuffling it back with Spin Doctor for the instant-speed install option.

### Description
We now lean harder into the fast advance strategy. Over-advancing :Card{name="Project Atlas"} is now more valuable than ever, as reaching 5 points means that by tutoring either a 3/2 agenda or :Card{name="Audacity"} gives you the immediate win (unless :Card{name="Clot"} as mentioned above).

Your game plan often involves building a scoring remote early that later gets used to house your upgrades and assets to force the Runner to interact with you and spend their resources.

Be aware that the win condition of the Runner now is :Card{name="Deep Dive"}, a very powerful game-ending card. You need to push forward with every one of your choices, pulling the Runner into uncomfortable positions until something fails. Either their economy or their available :Card{name="Simulchip" text="Simulchips"} to threaten a :Card{name="Clot"} install.

One useful strategy if you cannot find your :Card{name="Mavirus"} can be to bluff the fast advance of a 3/2 agenda with an :Card{name="Hostile Takeover"} instead to make them install Clot. This allows you to purge next turn to clear the coast for your fast advances.

### Standard meta game considerations
After the rotation of the bin breakers (:Card{name="Paperclip"}, :Card{name="Black Orchestra"}, :Card{name="MKUltra"}), many Runners have switched over to :Card{name="Aumakua"}, :Card{name="Leech"}, :Card{name="Botulus"}, and even :Card{name="Audrey v2"} as their go-to breaking solution without having to hard-install their three breakers of different types.

Especially :Card{name="Aumakua"} out of :Card{name="419: Amoral Scammer"}, can put up a lot of economic pressure on Corps. For that reason, many Corp decks were forced to include :Card{name="Mavirus"} as the only instant-speed purge effect in the card pool. While other decks have to swallow this bitter pill with its 1 influence and 3<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> cost, Ob can turn it into pure value, allowing much more flexibility and worst case offering a solid target for :Card{name="Extract"}, even when the purge is not needed. Also purging is valuable to reset the strength of your :Card{name="Sandstone"}.

Furthermore, :Card{name="Magnet"} is seeing quite a bit of play for similar reasons, to mitigate the power of :Card{name="Botulus"} to get into servers early and mess with Arissana decks.

#R2
### New cards
We now include some more cards from the entirety of Null Signals history (also called the Neo format) as well as some classic Shaper cards from Standard:
 
 * :Card{name="Arissana"} + :Card{name="Ika"} - While this ID has sparked a lot of convoluted deckbuilding, we went for the minimalist approach. This CROW list is already including all Trojans that we will have in the final competitive list. Your ID allows installing the :Card{name="Pichação"} very flexibly and also can clicklessly install Ika on a run you're doing anyways. Other than that, you can also use it to install an :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} or :Card{name="Pelangi"} (see next card) during the run when you need it.
 * :Card{name="Engolo"} + :Card{name="Pelangi"} - One big advantage of this type of Shaper build is that all your breaking needs get covered primarily by :Card{name="Engolo"}. It allows you to :Card{name="Paintbrush" text='"paint"'} the ice you encounter for only 2<span class="icon icon-credit"></span>. If you want to save even more money, simply use :Card{name="Pelangi"} with the same result. You can get into most servers by using these tools instead of "real" breakers. Keep in mind that Engolo costs 2<span class="icon icon-mu"></span>!
 * :Card{name="Deep Dive"} -  We replace :Card{name="Conduit"} for a more definite win condition. With one (or many) extra clicks from :Card{name="Pichação"} you can easily use Deep Dive to fetch 2 agendas. In a deck full of 2 pointers, touching 4 of them wins you the game. Contest some early scores in the remote. Hit HQ for single accesses or with :Card{name="Legwork"} and whenever you feel like the game is getting out of control, hit them with the Deep Dive to often end the game on the spot!
 * :Card{name="Clot"} - As the Corp is using fast advance to score out especially their final points, you can use :Card{name="Clot"} to throw a wrench in their machine. It shines best with instant-speed ways of installing it such as :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} or the following card :Card{name="Simulchip"}. Wait for the Corp to install and advance a card to then take priority before their next action. Use one of these instant-speed install tools to bring a Clot on the table, foiling their score and leaving their agenda ripe for stealing. Be aware that the Corp can use instant-speed purges from :Card{name="Mavirus"} to get rid of your Clot and score before you get priority to reinstall your Clot! Watch [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Fr6pI4o7M) by `@Sanjay` on the timing to use this card. 
 * :Card{name="Simulchip"} + :Card{name="Clot"} - A very versatile tool for all Shapers. Reuse your :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} to fetch another program. Juggle around :Card{name="Pichação"} for some very deep dives. And always keep one around to threaten the instant-speed install of a :Card{name="Clot"} to make fast advancing a difficult proposition.
 * :Card{name="Dr. Nuka Vrolyck"} - Some more draw to turn this deck into a well-oiled machine
 * :Card{name="Environmental Testing"} - A card that has been looking for a home in a competitive deck since its printing. This deck is capable of installing and reinstalling cards over and over again and often easily reaches the 4 triggers for payout. Always draw first before installing your cheap installables in hope of drawing an Environmental Testing to profit from it!
 * :Card{name="Paladin Poemu"} - This is the grease for your install machine, effectively gaining one credit per turn and an additional credit on every steal, as you will always find ways of using the credits off of it. Be aware that you cannot install :Card{name="Dr. Nuka Vrolyck"} with it!

### Description
With :Card{name="Simulchip"} and the simple breaking solution of :Card{name="Engolo"} and :Card{name="Pelangi"}, we can now very quickly get to a point where we can run with impunity. You will need to watch your credit total closely, as dipping down below 5 means that you cannot use any :Card{name="Sure Gamble"} that you draw. Dipping below 3 makes your other two money resources hard to install. So be careful with how much pressure you apply and lean back if necessary behind the protection of threatening a :Card{name="Clot"} install.

Be aware that the Corp is now playing the :Card{name="Stavka"} + :Card{name="Hafrún"} combo. This means that whenever a 3-cost card is rezzed, an unrezzed card could be a :Card{name="Stavka"} hitting two of your programs, while disabling one of your breakers by using :Card{name="Hafrún"}. Make sure to either have two different solutions to break a Stavka (e.g. an :Card{name="Ika"}) or have Simulchips at hand to reinstall whatever gets trashed.

Also be aware of a timing quirk with :Card{name="Arissana"}. When you initiate a run on a server with unrezzed ice on the outside, the timing around when you can use your ID trigger is awkward. The window in which the Corp gets to rez their ice is the "approach ice step". To do so, you technically first pass priority to them and then they get to decide whether to rez ice. The problem here is that if they decide not to, you do not get priority back and move on to the "movement step" as the ice is unrezzed. If you wanted to use :Card{name="Pichação"} on that ice, your only chance of ensuring to get to do so is by installing it _before_ the Corp makes their rez decision. Of course if they do rez the ice, you still have a lot of time and can install :Card{name="Pichação"} either on the "approach ice" step or the "encounter ice" step, where you would normally break the subroutines.

### Standard meta game considerations
There are quite a few decks out there utilising fast advance strategies, such as :Card{name="Outfit"} decks with :Card{name="Audacity"} and :Card{name="Big Deal"}, HB decks with :Card{name="Biotic Labor"} and :Card{name="Big Deal"} and NBN decks with :Card{name="Shipment from Vladisibirsk"} and :Card{name="SanSan City Grid"}. :Card{name="Clot"} is a good way of keeping those outs in check, as long as the Runner is quick enough to otherwise keep up with the Corp.

Furthermore with the rotation of :Card{name="Apocalypse"}, tech cards like :Card{name="Crisium Grid"} have become very rare in the meta game, opening up the road towards relatively easy hits with :Card{name="Deep Dive"}. We therefore switch our win condition to this very powerful one.

:nrdb_ids: level3

#C3

### New cards
We arrive at the final stage. This is the actual deck that we played at EMEA Continentals 2023. There are a few important changes from the stage 2 list:

 * :Card{name="Tucana"} - We now arrive at tutoring heaven. You will be searching through your R&D pretty much every single turn, sometimes even multiple times per turn. This gives you a lot of consistency, as you can pick and choose which ice you need where and free up your Ob triggers to fetch other cards. Both :Card{name="Calibration Testing"} and :Card{name="Mavirus"} as well as :Card{name="Extract" text="Extracting"} any 3-cost card will lead you to Tucana. Fetch this as early as you can and profit from every single score, making your servers more invulnerable in the process. Especially so, now that the Runner is using :Card{name="Hermes"} as their console and will bounce all your unrezzed cards, so make good use of the fact that both Ob and Tucana bring cards into play rezzed.
 * :Card{name="Border Control"} - An ice that is already good on its own, but shines especially in Ob. This is your primary target to fetch with Tucana, as it acts as a gear check forcing a breaker on the table and then can be used during the run to end it and fetch a different 3-cost card. Typical targets are :Card{name="Mavirus"}, :Card{name="Calibration Testing"} if the Runner happens to be running into this on their last click or :Card{name="Afshar"} / :Card{name="Magnet"} / :Card{name="Sandstone"} as great 3 cost ice options.

### Description
This deck offers many options at every point of the match. With all the tutoring effects, you can basically just pick and choose, which cards you'd want from R&D right now.

You can use a neat trick with :Card{name="Tucana"} while scoring an agenda that is not :Card{name="Azef Protocol"}. Fetch a Stavka triggering its on-rez ability. This gives you a trash that triggers your identity, which you can use to turn an :Card{name="Ice Wall"} into a :Card{name="Spin Doctor"} and shuffle away the agendas you threw away with :Card{name="Audacity"} or :Card{name="Slash and Burn Agriculture"} while scoring the agenda in the first place.

The Runner deck will force you to go at break-neck speeds to avoid getting locked out by the combination of :Card{name="Clot"} against the fast advance and :Card{name="Hermes"} + multi-access cards to bounce any agenda you try to score slowly in your remote. With :Card{name="Tucana"} you can defend yourself while keeping up the speed of the game, putting ice where it's needed most and turning some of it into other cards with :Card{name="Extract"} later on.

A typical play pattern is building up a big scoring remote early on to score the first 2-4 points and then later on trying to fast advance to get over the finish line.
You can actually install :Card{name="Mavirus"} on any server, so pick one of your centrals to defend particularly heavily (often HQ) to then still be able to fast advance through a :Card{name="Clot"}.

#R3
### New cards
We arrive at the final stage. This is the actual deck that we played at EMEA Continentals 2023. Not much has changed from stage 2, but one of the changes is very important.

 * -2 :Card{name="Pantograph"} +2 :Card{name="Hermes"} - This new console from The Automata Initiative replicates the effect of a previous Criminal identity: :Card{name="Leela Patel: Trained Pragmatist"}. What might seem innocuous at first glance is a beast of a card. The Corp installed and advanced something in their remote? Would be a shame if it got bounced back to HQ. The Corp only has a single piece of ice on a server. Let's steal something and open that server up completely. Some well-timed agenda steals can be devastating to Corp board states. Install this as soon as you find it and can afford it.
 * -1 :Card{name="Paladin Poemu"} +1 Paricia - This change frees up three influence (the stage 2 list was floating 3 unused influence) for Hermes. Other than that it is mainly meant for other matchups and only incidentally helps trash a :Card{name="Spin Doctor"} or a :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"}. Use this to trigger :Card{name="Environmental Testing"} and then feel free to trash it to activate your :Card{name="Simulchip"}.

### Description
:Card{name="Hermes"} opens up even more lines of play. You do not only get to use :Card{name="Clot"} to deny the option of fast advancing cards, but you can use your multi access tools in :Card{name="Legwork"} and :Card{name="Deep Dive"} to also contest never advance attempts (installing an agenda to score next turn without advancing it). If you see the Corp on 5 points installing something in a remote, it might be time to fire off your multi access to fish for an agenda and bounce that card back into HQ. Rinse and repeat until you reach 7 points.

Be aware that controlling all options of the Corp can be difficult to sustain and they now have tools like :Card{name="Border Control"} in their deck, that can block Deep Dive attempts or at least make them very unprofitable. You are on a fast clock, especially with their :Card{name="Tucana"} triggering on every score and steal, so make every click and every credit count!
