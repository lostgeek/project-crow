# CROW 3: Multiple matchups
:Toc{}
For the third iteration of Project CROW released in March 2020, I was particularly ambitious and have done three separate decks for each side. While these were designed mainly for their respective matchups, they can be played in any combination.

## Jinteki: Replicating Perfection
::NrdbDecks
---
:nrdb_ids: jinteki
---
#C1
This deck represents the asset spammy side of Netrunner. We're starting with a moderate 18 assets, to then ramp up to 24 on level 2 and 27 on level 3. Your game plan is simple: play a lot of unprotected assets that the Runner can't deal with in time to generate you forward momentum. There is :Card{name="Daily Business Show"} to filter your draws and prevent agenda flooding. There are :Card{name="Marilyn Campaign"}, :Card{name="Mumba Temple"}, :Card{name="PAD Campaign"}, and :Card{name="Sundew"} for economy (the latter of which you might want to even ice). And there is :Card{name="Jeeves Model Bioroids"} for insane click value. It allows you to score 4/2 agendas in a single turn without advancing them in the prior turn. This allows for never-advance plays in your scoring remote, where you keep the Runner guessing on what you installed.

Protect your centrals with small, but taxing ice like :Card{name="Eli 1.0"}, :Card{name="Enigma"} and :Card{name="Hunter"} to make the most out of your ID ability. Install a lot of assets that provide you forward tempo and set up a scoring remote.

#C2
We're turning up the asset dial with the second level of this asset spammy deck.
A few operations and ice needed to get removed to now feature an astounding 24 assets.
We added two new assets, which are central to your new game plan.
:Card{name="Political Dealings"} allows you to never have to bother actually building a scoring remote.
Just protect R&D and the Political Dealings remote and score directly from the top of your deck.
Additionally, you now also have :Card{name="Team Sponsorship"} to profit from your scores.
If the Runner took the time and effort to actually trash your things, use Team Sponsorship to get them back and overwhelm the Runner with your ever-growing board state.

The main part of your ice suite is meant to slow down the Runner with gear check ice like :Card{name="Envelope"}, :Card{name="Crick"} and :Card{name="Enigma"}.
To actually stop them, you will need your key new piece of ice: :Card{name="Tour Guide"}.
Once you set up your board full of rezzed assets, this thing becomes a monster with 10+ end the run subroutines.
Use this to protect your R&D and Political Dealings and close out games faster than the Runner can find enough money to contest any of it.

#C3
Welcome to the final level of the RP deck.
This is a competitive list initially created by `@Tugtetgut` and refined by `@Jakuza` and `@percomis` that won the German Nats team event as well as placing second in the main event.
First of: We're turning those :Card{name="Hedge Fund"} into assets as well to land at a whopping 27 assets.
We've now got a single copy of :Card{name="Snare!"} to keep the runner honest.
Two copies of :Card{name="Tech Startup"} to fetch the assets you need (keep in mind that this happens "when your turn begins", so you can't grab other assets with start-of-turn triggers and trigger them as in the same turn).
And finally a bit of really good acceleration in :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"}.

The ice suite also changes a bit, now adding a single copy of :Card{name="Yagura"} as good cheap ice and :Card{name="Thimblerig"} to optimize ice placement in the mid to late game.
The two expensive :Card{name="Tsurugi"} are replaced with :Card{name="Cortex Lock"} to keep the runner from making early runs too carelessly.

And finally the most important new bit of tech: :Card{name="Flower Sermon"}.
This card is amazing and enables you to find and install agendas with :Card{name="Political Dealings"} pretty much whenever you need one.
You can use it once per turn, so this means you can fire it once after the Runner's last click and then directly afterwards on the start of your turn.
This allows you to do any one of the following tricks:

  * Install a card from HQ by using the first Sermon trigger to put it on top of R&D and then draw it with the second Sermon trigger.
  * Play around :Card{name="Clot"} by installing the Agenda on the Runner's turn.
  * Use :Card{name="Daily Business Show"} to get rid of agendas in HQ by using the trigger on the Runner's turn and then using the DBS on your mandatory draw.
  * Keep R&D safe by being able to put Snare! on there whenever you want.

## Hayley Kaplan: Universal Scholar
::NrdbDecks
---
:nrdb_ids: shaper
---
#R1
This deck is the first step into the archetypical Shaper deck in the current meta.
It uses :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"} as the central econ engine piece and installs a lot of cards that are meant to stay on the board temporarily.
In this first iteration, those temporary value-giving pieces are :Card{name="Harbinger"} and :Card{name="Rezeki"}.
Contrary to the common misconception, Rezeki is not meant to actually stick on the board until the end of time.
It is much more valuable as a piece in Aesop's decks, where you play multiple copies, install them early, get a 5-7 turns of value out of them, and then just sell it off to Aesop's once you actually need the memory for your other stuff.
In the average case of 6 turns of drip economy, you got 4<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> of value and then even more out of Aesop's.
This is at least as good as a Sure Gamble, and you'd certainly play three more of those, if you were allowed to.

More nifty interactions exist with :Card{name="Harbinger"} and :Card{name="Daily Casts"}.
Harbinger can be sold to Aesop's twice, since the first sell will not trash it, but actually turn it face down to be sold again in a future turn.
Daily Casts can also be sold, if you sequence your start of turn triggers correctly. Let's say you start the turn with 4<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> on Daily Casts.
You first trigger Daily Casts to get the 2<span class="icon icon-credit"></span>. Then you trigger Aesop's to sell the Daily Casts and gain a further 3<span class="icon icon-credit"></span>.

Otherwise, this deck is relatively straight forward.
Try to mulligan for Professional Contacts.
Once you find it, install it and keep clicking on it on every instance.
This will generate a steady flow of credits and cards that then can be sold for more credits.
#R2
With level 2, we introduce a new Shaper ID: :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan"}, the bread and butter of competitive Shaper play.
While other Shaper IDs might have :Card{name="Rielle" text="fun"} :Card{name="Jesminder" text="little"} :Card{name="Akiko Nisei" text="quirks"}, Hayley provides powerful click compression for doing the things you already want to do anyways: Get your board set up.

To help you doing this even more quickly, we also gain another fun tool in our arsenal: :Card{name="Simulchip"}.
In conjunction with :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"}, this allows you to very quickly set up all of your breakers at once, e.g., on a :Card{name="Stimhack"} run.
Because of this added utility, we also change our sentry breaker to :Card{name="Ika"}.
Once hosted on a sentry, this little breaker is very efficient, costed at 0<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> and with cheap abilities.
Be careful though, as the Corp might overinstall their sentry to get rid of your squid friend.
You should immediately use Simulchip here to get it back quickly.

Finally, we now have a single copy of a silver bullet against fast advance decks: :Card{name="Clot"}.
This little program can be used to stop the Corp from winning the game right under your nose.
Use it together with a combination of :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"}, :Card{name="Simulchip"} and your :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan" text="ID ability"} to get it out at instant speed from stack, heap, or grip respectively, once the Corp has installed and advanced an agenda on the board.
#R3
We're finally there: This is `@Heinzel`'s "boring" Hayley deck that placed third at German Nats.
The main body of the list does not change much, it just gets a lot more tools geared towards efficiency.

Let's start with the resources, where we now include the :Card{name="Artist Colony"} + :Card{name="Fan Site"} engine, which allows you to fetch whatever card you're missing at instant speed.
And if you don't actually need those Fan Sites, you can also just sell them off to :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"}.

Your scoring plan has changed quite a bit.
Gone are the :Card{name="R&D Interface"}, which were replaced by :Card{name="Stargate"}, a powerful R&D pressuring tool released in Downfall.
Once you're set up, you can use Stargate to dig for agendas and/or keep trashing ICE to keep R&D open for longer.
And once you find an agenda, you now have :Card{name="Freedom Through Equality" fullname=true} to cash in an additional point if needed, when you grab it from archives.

As a tool against the grindier matchups (like :Card{name="Jinteki: Personal Evolution"}, which I did not include in this series), you have got :Card{name="Buffer Drive"}.
And finally you now have got :Card{name="Misdirection"}, which helps a lot against :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"}.
Once it is on the table, the maths around HHN change a lot to your favor.

## Argus Security: Protection Guaranteed
::NrdbDecks
---
:nrdb_ids: weyland
---
#C1
This deck is the first step to the punishing tempo Weyland deck that is most typically played out of :Card{name="Argus Security"}.
You plan is to set up forks for the Runner, where they either give you a score or steal the agenda and are worse off for that.
The central card to enable this is :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"}, which punishes the Runner for running with too little credits.
This is a key piece to a lot of Standard meta decks and a lot of Runner decks revolve around dealing with this card.

Your ice is rather small, but has End the Run subroutines to make the Runner install their breakers.
This creates a window, where to get into your servers they might have taken an economic hit, which you can punish with Hard-Hitting News.
Once the News hit, you can use :Card{name="High-Profile Target"} to finish the game rather spectacularly.
And as a final piece, you have got :Card{name="Consulting Visit"} to always have access to the operations you need.

To create the tempo that you need to overwhelm the Runner, you have #rashida, which is a widely used asset in all sorts of meta decks.
And finally :Card{name="Forced Connection"} is an upgrade to make your remote even more taxing.

#C2
Weyland is pumping up the heat with a new ID and a couple of cards that make it ever easier for the Runner to slip and end up in tag hell.
Let's start with your new ID: :Card{name="Argus Security"}.
Whenever the runner thinks they're safe to get in to your remote and steal your agendas, your ID makes them pay for it, either by losing 2 cards or a tag (to say: a click and two credits).

If that's not enough, you can up the pressure by installing :Card{name="Prisec"} together with your agendas: Another tag, another bit of damage.
And once the runner is able to reliably get into your remote, bait them a few more times with :Card{name="NGO Front"}.
Once their economy inevitably crumbles under your pressure, use :Card{name="Economic Warfare"} and :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"} to tag them and finish it with your old and trusty :Card{name="High-Profile Target"}.

Your final new toy to play with is :Card{name="Border Control"}, which in conjunction with :Card{name="Data Raven"} allows you to tax the Runner out not only on credits but also on their clicks.
Make them run through the same Raven multiple times, just to be greeted by your Prisec-filled remote.

#C3
We've now arrived at the final level of the Argus list.
This is the deck, that was played by `@longi` at German Nats standing undefeated at both the team and main event.

If you had problems closing out games in the earlier iterations, you now have access to one copy of :Card{name="Audacity"}, which is included as a way of closing out games using :Card{name="Project Atlas"} tokens.
Try to overadvance your Project Atlas early on, when the Runner can't steal it (be it because they're missing a breaker or because running might trigger :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"}) and then cruise to a quick win later on in the game.

Furthermore, you now have :Card{name="Too Big to Fail"} to quickly refresh your economy with an obvious downside later on.
Argus games typically end with 3-4 bad publicity, which can spiral out of control very quickly for you, so be mindful of when to use it.

The ice suite was fleshed out a bit with a copy of :Card{name="Afshar"} to protect HQ and three copies of :Card{name="Mausolus"} which is a great piece of annoying ice, even when you have bad publicity.
And on the sentry side you've got :Card{name="Surveyor"} and :Card{name="Winchester"} mostly to force the Runner into installing their sentry breaker.
It's rare that you install more than 2-3 pieces of ice on a single server, so don't try to get maximum value out of your Surveyor, while losing on another server.

The Agenda suite changed only a small bit replacing the :Card{name="Oaktown Renovation"} by :Card{name="Armed Intimidation"}, which in combination with :Card{name="High-Profile Target"} can outright kill a careless runner on three cards in their grip, if you install and double advance it on the previous turn.

## Hoshiko Shiro: Untold Protagonist
::NrdbDecks
---
:nrdb_ids: anarch
---
#R1
This is the first step towards the archetypical ice destruction deck.
You are probably already familiar with the basic framework of breakers from the System Core 2019 setting.
Additionally, you're getting :Card{name="Chisel"} and :Card{name="Devil Charm"}, which in combination allow you to blow up ice on approach, so you don't even need to encounter and break it at all.
You need to balance preemptively installing Chisel as a pseudo bypass with running into ice with your face and making them pay the rez cost, just for you to then install Chisel on it and blow it up on your next approach.
To have more flexible access to your Chisels, you have :Card{name="Simulchip"}, which allows you to fetch a Chisel at instant speed.
You can actually do this in reaction to the corp rezzing a piece of ice.

The other addition to the card pool are :Card{name="Paladin Poemu"} and :Card{name="Keiko"}, which are from the group of companions introduced in NISEIs Ashes cycle.
While Keiko gives you the memory needed for installing your Chisels and :Card{name="Datasucker" text="Datasuckers"}, it also provides additional value together with Poemu to install all of your other things.

#R2
We're furthering our plan of getting rid of every piece of ice we can find with a lot of new cards.
Let's start with our ID: :Card{name="Hoshiko Shiro"}.
This is one of NISEIs new flip IDs with two sides.
You start on the sad side and flip your ID, once you accessed a card in your turn.
The other side will draw you a card in exchange for a credit (good thing you got two for flipping it), as long as you keep accessing cards in your turns.
The best course of action often is to keep flipping your ID every turn, so that you get the maximum value out of both sides of your ID.
Also keep in mind that the reverse side of your ID not only has different text, but also 1 link and the subtype **digital**, the former being important against cards like :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"} and the latter being important for a new addition to this list: :Card{name="DreamNet"}.

:Card{name="DreamNet"} further rewards you for running by giving you a card (and a credit if your ID is flipped).
To kill even more pieces of ice, you have access to :Card{name="Hippo"}.
With this card you can either trash the rezzed outermost piece of ice or make the Corp anxious of rezzing it.
Either way you're happy with the result.
Finally you have :Card{name="Stargate"}, which is a powerful card to finish out games with.
Open up R&D with your ice destruction tools and then keep using Stargate to trash ice that you find, to make them never draw into any further ice.
Keep in mind that Stargate _does not_ shuffle R&D!

#R3
We've arrived at the final level of this list.
This is the Hoshiko list that `@Saan` played to 6th place at the German Nationals.
Only two cards have changed, but the changes are impactful: one copy of :Card{name="Career Fair"} and :Card{name="Earthrise Hotel"}.
Instead we're now playing :Card{name="Rebirth"} and :Card{name="Labor Rights"}.

:Card{name="Rebirth"} is a great card in the mid to late game of Anarch and allows you to switch out your identity for another one in your faction.
While this may sound like a whole lot of options to consider, it boils down to three (and to be honest.. more down to one).

In 95% of board states, it is correct to rebirth into :Card{name="Omar Keung"}.
If you're unsure, just pick Omar. If you're sure that you want another ID, still pick Omar.
Omar is an enormous pressuring tool for centrals and forces the Corp to spread their ice thin, which in combination with your ice destruction strategy can be devastating.

For completeness sake, here are the other two options to consider:
:Card{name="Edward Kim"} can be good in matchups like :Card{name="Argus Security"}.
Once you've gotten rid of all their tag punishment tools, you can run through their :Card{name="Data Raven" text="Data Ravens"} with impunity (at least if you don't need your resources that much...).
It can also heavily disrupt combo based strategies like Spombo Asa by hitting key tools (for example :Card{name="Archived Memories"} when both :Card{name="Game Changers"} are in the bin or their :Card{name="Fully Operational"}).

And finally you can also choose :Card{name="Quetzal"}, if you somehow lost access to your :Card{name="Corroder"} or there is an high strength barrier with a single subroutine.
The other Anarch identities are almost never seen as rebirth targets.

The other new addition is :Card{name="Labor Rights"}, which allows you to recycle your ice destruction tools once you run out of deck.
This is an option for the late game against slower corps.

## Asa Group: Security Through Vigilance
::NrdbDecks
---
:nrdb_ids: haasbioroid
---
#C1
In this iteration of Project CROW, I wanted to get a little bit more experimental and offer a list for more experienced players.
With HB, we're trying to lead to `@pinsel`s winning deck from German Nationals: [Spombo Asa](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/58377/spombo-asa-1st-at-german-nationals-2019).
For this we need to understand two prior HB archetypes that Spombo Asa is built on: Jammy HB and Spombo which is a combination of the words :Card{name="Sportsmetal: Go Big or Go Home"} and Combo.

We're starting with Jammy HB, which is a list that tries to just jam stuff into their remote at every given opportunity.
For this you have two upgrades to aid you in your plan: :Card{name="Tranquility Home Grid"} and :Card{name="Arella Salvatore"}.
Tranquility Home Grid is a plain value generator.
Since your plan is to jam something into the remote at all times, this card will trigger every turn.
When you manage to score something, Arella will then help you keep your tempo up, by installing the next thing and even advancing it once.

Jammy decks typically are ok with trying to score behind somewhat porous servers.
You're trying to out-tempo the Runner by overwhelming their economy and this means that they need to run your remote often.
To elicit this, you're playing :Card{name="NGO Front"}, which looks like an Agenda to the runner, but can be trashed before the access to generate money for you and keep the Runner guessing on your remote plays.

#C2
We'll continue our dangerous journey with a delve into combo territory.
This is the :Card{name="Sportsmetal"} Combo deck, in short: Spombo.
As you can see, you have _a lot_ of agendas, much more than you can realistically score.
Good thing your plan is not to actually score them the normal way.

While it is good to know what each of your agendas does, you only really need to know that you're playing 14 3/1 agendas and two copies of :Card{name="Project Vacheron"}.
Project Vacheron is a great agenda, because it is worth 3 points to you, but 0 points for the Runner in the relevant turns.
Your main game plan is to feed the Runner agendas left and right, while being careful to not give them the full 7 points that they actually need to win.
Once they are on 5-7 agendas in their score area, your real plan kicks into motion.

### It's combo time

You have :Card{name="Game Changer"} to quickly gain a lot of clicks to then draw and install a bunch of cards using :Card{name="Fast Break"}.
In your combo turn, your remotes should look like this:

  * A clown car remote with a lot of cards: 1x :Card{name="Breaker Bay Grid"}, 1x :Card{name="Arella Salvatore"}, 1x any 3/1 agenda, and some copies of :Card{name="Calibration Testing"}.
  * Two remotes containing :Card{name="Team Sponsorship"}
  * A total of two :Card{name="Calibration Testing"} in your remote, your Archives, and HQ.

Once you have this set up, you can score out the 3/1 agenda in your remote. This will trigger a bunch of cards: Use :Card{name="Sportsmetal"} to draw you into more of your scoreable agendas. Use :Card{name="Team Sponsorship"} to get back two :Card{name="Calibration Testings"} and use :Card{name="Arella Salvatore"} to install another 3/1 agenda in your remote with an advancement token.
You can use :Card{name="Breaker Bay Grid"} to rez the :Card{name="Calibration Testing" text="Calibration Testings"} without paying the rez cost and use them to add the two missing advancement tokens.
Score the agenda and begin anew. Draw for agendas as needed and keep the scoring train rolling to 7 points.

While in a perfect scenario, you are 100% certain that your combo is ready, in most cases, you will need to fire the combo somewhat blindly and hope to draw into all necessary pieces with your :Card{name="Fast Breaks"}.

Watch out for your Team Sponsorships. Losing more than one of them can be devastating, as you need two to easily combo out.
One Team Sponsorship can get you back the other, but this may cost you precious clicks.

### Further things to keep in mind
Since you actually want to make the Runner steal your agendas, use them tactically.
Protect your upgrades with them so that the Runner trashing your stuff means that they at least had to steal an agenda for it (weird to look at it that way, right?).
Threaten scoring out Vacheron by double advancing it to make them steal.
Install multiple copies of :Card{name="Research Grant"} against a Runner that is refusing to check your stuff and score them all at once.
Feed a :Card{name="Megaprix Qualifier"} early to make them worth more to you later.

Your greatest enemy is :Card{name="Stargate"}, since it can trash your #vacheron.
If the Runner can steal :Card{name="Project Vacheron"} from Archives, they will immediately get the 3 points.
Make sure your R&D is iced up and prioritize this before icing up any other server.

#C3
With the final level of the HB list, we're once again turning the whole deck upside down.
This is the winning deck of the German Nationals built and played by `@Pinsel` and it is a wild ride of a deck.
It combines the ideas behind Spombo Sportsmetal that we explored in level 2 together with his Worlds winning [Combo Asa](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57206) (yes, he won both Worlds and German Nats...).
While Spombo Sportsmetal used the draw generated by :Card{name="Asa Group" text="the identity"} and :Card{name="Fast Break"}, in Asa we have to use another way: :Card{name="Fully Operational"}.

This card can generate insane levels of value.
If you only evaluate it by the credits it generates, it is on par with :Card{name="Beanstalk Royalties"} on one iced remote, :Card{name="IPO"} on two remotes, and surpasses them all at three or more remotes.
And believe me, there will be a lot of iced remotes.
Your identity allows you to quickly drop an asset behind a piece of ice in a single click.
This makes the additional requirement of Fully Operational pretty easy to fulfill.

But this is only evaluating the card on its credit value.
The real trick lies in drawing cards that can be so much more valuable than simple credits.
This list tries to out-tempo the Runner by simply doing so many things at once that they can't possibly control everything.
This mostly means installing things in remotes, which needs to be fueled by card draw.
For this you've got full sets of three cards: :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"}, :Card{name="Fully Operational"}, and :Card{name="Violet Level Clearance"}.
The last one can be a bit tricky, because it is a **Terminal** card, meaning that you end your turn after playing it.
This means you instantly go over to the discard step without any window to install the cards that you drew, so be mindful of when you use it.
You can discard the first copy of :Card{name="Game Changer"} as well as some pieces of ice, if you drew too many, and the 1-point agendas :Card{name="Hyperloop Extension"} or :Card{name="Megaprix Qualifier"}, especially if you think the runner might run archives.

The deck does have the strategy that Spombo Sportsmetal also had of using :Card{name="Arella Salvatore"} + :Card{name="Calibration Testing"} to advance up to 7 points at once.
But much more often the scoring pattern of this list consists of either mini combos for 3-4 points in the mid game or using :Card{name="Game Changer"} to score out a :Card{name="Project Vacheron"} for the final 3 points for the win.
The Arella combo is not the main plan but more of a threat that the Runner has to keep in check.
This means they need to actively search and trash your :Card{name="Team Sponsorship" text="Team Sponsorships"} and all the upgrades, breaking their economy, and allowing you to dictate the pace of the game.

The main enabler of this entire strategy is :Card{name="Project Vacheron"}.
There are a lot of games, where the Runner is sitting on 10 points, just waiting for their Vacherons to tick down.
To quote `@percomis` in a number of matches: 
> I just need to not lose for one more f*@$=/$ turn! 
>
> — percomis, shortly before losing

When you are hard-pressed to win the game _in this exact turn_ is when the deck shines the most.
Assuming the runner has a number of agendas in their score area, :Card{name="Game Changer"} can provide you with a lot of clicks.
You will often not have the right cards in hand to combo out from here, so if you set up your board well enough, you can now use :Card{name="Fully Operational"} for 6-10 draws.
It is not rare that you draw your entire deck in the final turn to find that one missing card that has been hiding on the bottom of your R&D.

The last point to consider is ice placement.
You only have 11 pieces of ice and their placement is extremely crucial for your strategy.
I can not give easy guidelines for what to place where, as that depends a lot on the economic and breaker situation of the runner.
In general, you want to use the ice to deter the runner from trashing your pieces as well as keeping your centrals safe (enough).
This can mean that you use simple end-the-run ice like :Card{name="Vanilla"} to not strain your own economy too much.
This can also mean that you want to stack your :Card{name="Drafter" text="Drafters"}, to make the runner move their :Card{name="Ika"} every time they break it.
Keep in mind that :Card{name="Gatekeeper"} is not only good for ending the run, but also for accelerating your own game by giving you three more draws.
You'll often happily pay 3<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> to draw those 3 cards.
Do not make the mistake of shuffling back your :Card{name="Project Vacheron"} too hastily.
Often it serves you better in HQ or on the board, because it can easily get hit out of R&D by :Card{name="Stargate"} and provide instant 3 points to the runner.

This deck is not only the most skill-testing deck in this iteration of Project CROW, but is certainly one of the most demanding decks in the history of the game, so I'd recommend a few games just playing on your own and assuming the runner to win on 5 agendas on turn 9 (for example because they stole the winning Vacheron on turn 5).

#R1
This is the first step into the archetypical :Card{name="419"} deck.
We're starting off with a standard Criminal build that you probably are already familiar with from the System Core 2019 setting.
The central addition here is :Card{name="Aumakua"}, which is a very powerful AI, that gets stronger every time you access cards (and do not trash or steal them).
This will very quickly force the Corp to regularly purge virus tokens and win you time for your powerful win conditions in :Card{name="The Maker's Eye"} and :Card{name="Legwork"}.

Otherwise the deck is straight forward.
Play aggressively once you have your Aumakua out and try to overwhelm the corporation.

#R2
We're stepping further into the credit denial Criminal archetype by adding a new identity: :Card{name="419"}.
You're making the Corp either pay you 1<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> or one piece of information, either way you're typically happy with the outcome.
And once you got your :Card{name="Aumakua"} up, every time the Corp doesn't pay you, your Turtle gets a bit stronger.

If the Corp values their money highly, divert some of it by using :Card{name="Diversion of Funds"}.
The goal is to keep the Corp too poor to score out reliably.
To do this, you need to be able to set up quickly. In addition to the #diesel, we're now playing :Card{name="Deuces Wild"} as well.
This card is incredibly versatile with its baseline giving you 2 cards and 1<span class="icon icon-credit"></span>.
The other two options are more situational but can be much more valuable.
The expose and run option is great to scout out servers.
Keep in mind, that you do not have to run on the same server you used the expose effect on.
It can be great to expose the piece of ice on HQ and then run somewhere else, keep that information in mind and use a well-timed Diversion of Funds later on.
Also being able to clicklessly remove a tag after running can be very good against one of your level 2 opponents: :Card{name="Argus Security"}.

In the Resource category we've got two cute new additions in :Card{name="Mystic Maemi"} and :Card{name="Paladin Poemu"}.
These give you 1<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> of value every turn, if you are able to reliably use those credits for using events and installing (non-connection) cards.
To go with your credit denial plan, you've got :Card{name="PAD Tap"}.
The corp has two options, neither of which are very good for them.
Either pay a click and three credits to get rid of a card, you didn't even spend money on to play, or leave it on the board and give you an economic advantage that can stack up very quickly.

Finally, you've got :Card{name="The Class Act"} for some burst draw in the beginning and filtered draw afterwards.
And your game plan for central pressure has shifted away from #legwork and #maker's into :Card{name="The Turning Wheel"}.
You will naturally do enough central runs to fill up on Turning Wheel tokens that you can then later on dump to typically see the entirety of HQ.
It is also great to punish a non-spiky ice on the outside of a central, since the run doesn't actually need to be successful to gain a token.

#R3
We're finally there: this is a competitive 419 deck, that I played at DomeCon 2020.
We've only got a few new cards compared to the level 2 list, but these are very impactful.

The main change is that we're now playing three copies of :Card{name="Corporate Grant" fullname=true}.
1<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> per turn might not seem like much, but believe me, it will add up if the Corp is not in a position to score and clear the current.
Your game plan is once again to deny the Corp their economy by a combination of :Card{name="419" text="your ID ability"}, :Card{name="Corporate Grant" text="Grant"}, :Card{name="Diversion of Funds"}, and another new addition: :Card{name="Amina"}.

To free up slots to include the Grants, we've cut 2x :Card{name="Legwork"} and 1x :Card{name="Special Order"}.
Keep in mind that the only multi access now comes in the form of :Card{name="The Turning Wheel"}.
But by keeping the Corp economy in check, this should be enough to stay ahead, keep them from scoring, and in the end use Turning Wheel to access the entirety of HQ.
