# CROW 2: Hayley Kaplan vs. Pālanā Foods

:Toc{}
This is the second iteration of Project CROW and came out in October 2019. It is made for beginners familiar with System Core 2019. 
It is once again meant as a glimpse into current competitive Standard decks and shows a match between Jinteki and Shaper. It starts off with a match between :Card{name="Jinteki: Replicating Perfection"} against :Card{name="Chaos Theory: Wünderkind"} and ends up with :Card{name="Pālanā Foods: Sustainable Growth"} against :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan: Universal Scholar"} in four steps.

On every level the newly introduced cards are explained step by step until reaching the two decks that placed at second and tenth place played by `@Testrunning` and `@qvm` respectively at the [World Championship 2019](https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/2242/world-championship-2019) in Rotterdam!

## Stage 1
The Corporation deck revolves around taxing clicks as well as credits. Two of these cards are already in the System Core 19: :Card{name="Jinteki: Replicating Perfection"} and :Card{name="Nisei MK II"}. The third was released as part of the Champion Cards released at Magnum Opus 2018: :Card{name="Border Control"}. It is an ok piece of ice with a bit of facecheck punishment, but really shines with its paid ability: it can be trashed to end the run. So whenever the runner made a run, broke everything and would access the server, it can be trashed to stop the run and force them to spend another click and money to get in again.

The Corp can play some mind games with :Card{name="NGO Front"}, which was introduced in the Kitara Cycle. Like Border Control, it can be trashed as a paid ability just when the Runner would access it. This allows the Corp to force more Runs on the remote.

The final card that we're including in this first level of Project CROW is :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"}. A great card from the Kitara Cycle that accelerates the Corporation by providing cards and credits.

The Runner is a pretty standard :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop" text="Aesop's"} list. Find your :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"} and :Card{name="Professional Contacts"} to then draw cards, install them and sell them afterwards for profit. If left unpressured, these decks can accumulate 30+ credits very quickly that can then be used with the efficient breaker suite to get into the remote whenever needed.

Most of the cards in this deck come from the System Core 2019 with the exception of three: :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} (SMC in short), :Card{name="Clone Chip"} and :Card{name="Daily Casts"}. The first two cards are from Creation and Control and are the backbone of pretty much every Shaper deck since their release. SMC allows lean decklists with breakers as 1-of inclusions that are tutored when needed. With an SMC on the board, the Runner can contest the board very early on and :Card{name="Stimhack" text="Stimhacks"} can be used to get breakers out for "free". With Clone Chips they then have access to SMC at instant speed. Whenever a breaker is needed, one will appear out of thin air...

:nrdb_ids: level1

#C1
This deck wants to have ice on the outside of centrals that the Runner has to break (:Card{name="Enigma"}, :Card{name="Yagura"}, :Card{name="Hunter"}, :Card{name="Neural Katana"}, :Card{name="Tsurugi"}). Afterwards they can run your remote, which should be protected by your :Card{name="Border Control"} and expensive to break ice (:Card{name="Tollbooth"}, :Card{name="Tsurugi"}) to tax them out on both clicks and credits. You can try to force the Runner to check the Remote by installing and advancing :Card{name="NGO Fronts"} and :Card{name="Reversed Accounts"} as well as Agendas. Do not install the :Card{name="Snare!"}, since they are just to discourage them from running centrals with few cards in hand. This deck is not trying to win by killing the Runner.

#R1
Mulligan for :Card{name="Professional Contacts"}. Then start drawing for :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"}. These two cards are the economic backbone of the deck.

When there are 4 credits on your :Card{name="Daily Casts"}, you can stage your triggers in such a way that you first take off 2 credits off of Daily Casts and then sell it to Aesop's afterwards for 3 more credits. This is pretty important to always have cards to sell on board. Note: :Card{name="Armitage Codebusting"} and :Card{name="Ice Analyzer"} were included mostly as cheap fodder for Aesop's.

Your game plan is using :Card{name="Legwork"} to check HQ if you feel Agendas might start piling up there and :Card{name="R&D Interface"} to pressure R&D. In the best case you manage to lock R&D, which means that with 2 R&D Interfaces, you see the top three cards of R&D. Whenever they draw these cards, you run again to never allow them to draw into Agendas.

Keep in mind that you will probably need 3-4 clicks to get into the remote.

## Stage 2
In this level we're giving the corporation their win condition in :Card{name="La Costa Grid"}, which was part of NISEI's Uprising Booster Pack. It allows to score out :Card{name="Nisei MK II"} under the disguise of other assets. This will a whole new level of pressure on the runner.

The second vector of attack is :Card{name="Obokata Protocol"}, which puts the runner under a tempo constraint. Stealing it often means spending the next 4 clicks to draw back up.

This plays into the Corporation identity: :Card{name="Pālanā Foods: Sustainable Growth"}, which gains 1<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> the first time each turn the Runner draws a card.

The last important new addition is :Card{name="Excalibur"}, which is a piece of ice with the mythic subtype. This type of ice can not be broken by normal means and its subroutine will prevent the Runner from initiating any further runs on this turn. Together with :Card{name="Border Control"}, this allows the Corporation to score out any agenda they want. To stop this from happening, the Runner deck includes 3x :Card{name="Pelangi"} with which they can paint any subtype on the piece of ice they're encountering. This ability being only once per turn puts the Runner in some interesting decisions on recurring Pelangi with their :Card{name="Clone Chips"}.

#C2
The second new piece of ice :Card{name="Slot Machine"} can be very taxing to break for the Runner. Use these to ice up centrals lightly early on. Then start building a remote consisting of :Card{name="Border Control"} and :Card{name="Excalibur"} as well as other pieces of taxing ice and force them to run in there as often as possible.

#R2
In this level the Runner breaker suite changed considerably. Besides :Card{name="Corroder"} we now use :Card{name="Cyber-Cypher"} (short Cycy) and :Card{name="Ika"}, which are very efficient breakers with a quirk. Cycy only works on a single server, which has to be chosen when installing it. As an upside it starts with a whopping 4 strength and is a very efficient breaker. Together with :Card{name="Pelangi"}, this allows contesting even strongly iced remotes early on. :Card{name="Ika"} on the other hand has to be moved around constantly and is best when stationary on a single piece of problematic ice.

The :Card{name="Armitage Codebusting" text="Armitage Codebustings"}, that were mostly used as fodder for :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"} in the last level were now replaced with :Card{name="Cache"}. This card gives you incredible value combined with the new ID :Card{name="Hayley Kaplan: Universal Scholar"}. With Hayley you can often play as if your turns had 5 clicks by installing the program you wanted plus a Cache, which nets you 2c directly and 3c when sold to Aesop's at the start of next turn. Additionally you can even use Hayleys ID ability during the Corp's turn with :Card{name="Clone Chip"} and :Card{name="Self-modifying Code"} for even more value.

Try to always keep around at least one :Card{name="Clone Chip"} to be able to break an :Card{name="Excalibur"} in the case that the Corp purges virus tokens.

## Stage 3
We're now at a level, where this deck in the hands of a good player could do reasonably well at a competitive level. Most cards were replaced by their most efficient variants and allow a variety of lines of play.

The Corporation got some more tools as well as some nasty pieces of ice. Starting with the tools, we've got :Card{name="Bio Vault"}, which can either work to bait the Runner into an expensive run or - if they don't bite - as a means to stop a run later on. Together with :Card{name="Border Control"} this can make runs very much impossible, if not dealt with by the Runner.

The second tool is :Card{name="Scarcity of Resources"}, which can be used to slow down the Runner considerably. When under Scarcity, the Runner has to really think hard about whether installing that :Card{name="Daily Casts"} is really worth it (often enough it is not).

Finally we've got the three pieces of ice in :Card{name="DNA Tracker"}, :Card{name="Anansi"}, and :Card{name="Thimblerig"}. While the first two might seem very nasty, the third one is one of the most impressive pieces of ice released. At only 2<span class="icon icon-credit"></span> rez cost it does something that was only possible in very janky ways before: reposition ice. You have a costly and taxing piece of ice on the remote, but no agenda ready to score? Shift around those ice to put it on a central instead and wait for later. Be sure to familiarize yourself with time timing chart: You have to activate :Card{name="Thimblerig"} _before_ your mandatory draw, so you can't use that information to decide where to place your ice.

#C3
The game plan stays pretty much as before. Place your ice wisely and use :Card{name="Thimblerig"} to move them around efficiently.

#R3
As an answer to :Card{name="Scarcity of Resources"} on the Corp side, this deck runs a very slim suite of resources. You will have to install :Card{name="Aesop's Pawnshop"} and :Card{name="Professional Contacts"} even if Scarcity is in play, since they will pay for themselves down the line. Some of the resources that were used as fodder for Aesop's earlier have been changed to more copies of Ika. You can trash those for economic benefit freely early on.

## Stage 4
We've arrived at level 4. These are decks that people brought to the most competitive tournament of 2019: The world championship in Rotterdam!
On the Corp side we've arrived at _2 Grid for 2 Place_, which was played by `@Testrunning` to a first place finish at the Crown of Lasers side event as well as the second place in the main event. The final additions are :Card{name="IP Block"} and :Card{name="Cyberdex Virus Suite"} (short CVS), the first of which is comparable to :Card{name="Wall of Static"} in this matchup, but gives much needed punishment to AI breakers like :Card{name="Aumakua"}. CVS does fit the same role in protecting Archives against farming Aumakua tokens. In this matchup it doubles as a way of purging :Card{name="Pelangi"} mid-run and forcing a use of :Card{name="Clone Chip"}.

On the Runner side we've got _Surfing Rainbows (for value)_ built by `@qvm` and myself. While I myself only managed to get 106th place, `@qvm` and `@HerbartKlopstock` placed 10th and 65th with it. It swaps two of the :Card{name="Akamatsu Mem Chips"} for :Card{name="Astrolabe"}, which together with :Card{name="Paricia"} shores up the Asset spam matchup considerably and both can be sold to Aesop's if they should not be needed. Furthermore, we've got :Card{name="Clot"} for the Weyland matchup, which can be very hard to stop once they get to 5 points and can use :Card{name="Audacity"} to score the final 2 points for the win. And finally there is :Card{name="Misdirection"} to protect us against :Card{name="Hard-Hitting News"}, which you should already know from the previous iteration of Project CROW.

Regarding game play not much has changed since level 3. The newly included cards are mostly for shoring up all the other matchups, that I have neglected while building these duel decks.

Once again: Congratulations! You started out with decks near to the Core Experience and followed a path to end up with strong decks in the current meta. I hope, I managed to show you a few interesting cards and decisions in this matchup. There's many more to learn and I'm sure a lot of experienced players would love to play this matchup with you. Feel free to join the #beginners channel on Stimslack and/or DM me under `@lostgeek`. With your newly gained knowledge, you can also create and join lobbies on jinteki.net to battle against other decks. There's a lot to learn in those matchups too, but with the experience of at least 4 matches, you should be prepared a little bit more for those games!
