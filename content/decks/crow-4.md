# CROW 4: Hivemind MaxX vs Precision Design
:Toc{}
This is part of the fourth iteration of the Project CROW mini-campaign for beginners familiar with System Gateway. It consists of three Runner and three Corp decks, that are upgraded up over three stages. This time, they start with only cards from System Gateway, then visit the Startup format to end up with currently competitively viable decks in the Standard format that have placed well in tournaments. (See [here](https://nisei.net/players/supported-formats/) for further information on the tournament formats Startup and Standard)

## Stage 1
::NrdbDecks

:nrdb_ids: level1

#C1
With this :Card{name="Precision Design"} list, your game plan is very straight forward: Score your Agendas and do so quickly! The card enabling all of this is :Card{name="Seamless Launch"}. Install a 4/2 agenda in a well-defended server. use Seamless Launch to score it and grab back the Launch you just used to be ready to score the next one.

:Card{name="Offworld Office"} pays you back and then some more. With two of them, even scoring a :Card{name="Send a Message"} becomes very much possible without telegraphing the Agenda by advancing it the previous turn.

For defense you got both strong ice as well as :Card{name="Anoetic Void"} and :Card{name="Manegarm Skunkworks"} to make it very expensive for the Runner to get into your remote.

#R1
This is the beginning of a very virus-heavy trip. The events, hardware, and resources are mostly just filler to get enough draw and econ as the basis of the list. The real fun starts with the programs. While you have a complete breaker suite of :Card{name="Buzzsaw"}, :Card{name="Carmen"}, and :Card{name="Cleaver"}, supported by :Card{name="Leech"}, this is not your only way into servers.

Use :Card{name="Botulus"} as a tool for early game aggression together with your multi-access cards :Card{name="Jailbreak"} and :Card{name="Docklands Pass"}. Additionally throw a :Card{name="Fermenter"} down to either bring them to purge, giving you an entire turn, or to make easy money a few turns later.

:nrdb_ids: level2

#C2
We've sped up even more. With :Card{name="Cyberdex Sandbox"}, all of our 2-pointer agendas are now tempo-positive. Sandbox additionally helps you deal with the flood of virusses that the chosen Runner for this matchup will be bringing.

Furthermore, you now have :Card{name="La Costa Grid"} to help you chain agendas even faster. With it, it's possible to score an agenda with :Card{name="Seamless Launch"} and then jam the second one right after.

Your ice suite has gotten some strong additions with :Card{name="Hagen"} trashing their virusses and :Card{name="Drafter"} giving you powerful recursion and tempo options.

And finally you have :Card{name="Magnet"}, which can be amazing if rezzed at the right moment to pull their Botulus and disable it.

#R2
We're upping the number of virusses (and the decisions) significantly. Now we add :Card{name="Chisel"}, which together with :Card{name="Devil Charm"} can deal with any ice with 6 strength or less (take a good look at the timing chart, to understand the difference between approach and encounter).
Furthermore, :Card{name="Imp"} is joining for some easy trashes of any card that looks at you funny.

And finally we add an entire new win condition: :Card{name="Conduit"}. Use your ice destruction with Chisel and efficient breakers to drill into R&D and find the agendas you need to win.

You need to adapt your play style very dynamically to the board and :Card{name="Simulchip"} allows you to do exactly that. Install your :Card{name="Botulus"} early on centrals and pressure with :Card{name="Jailbreak"}. Once they rez their ice, slow down a bit, use the Botulus tokens that are building up, but if you get iced out, just keep building your board. And once they try to score something in their remote, just use the Simulchips to shift your Botuli from centrals to the remote and fill in the gaps in your breaker suite.

Note: If you use Simulchip during approach, you can instantly kill any 0 strength ice (and even 1 strength together with :Card{name="Cookbook"})

Also note that while :Card{name="Wildcat Strike"} has the option of drawing your cards, in almost every situation it is correct for the Corp to give you money instead. So do not rely on this drawing you cards.

Finally we arrive at [Seamless Rush](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/64839/seamless-rush-1rst-7th-10th-at-early-bird-9-0-) which some of team NWE brought to the first big tournament of the Gateway meta. We're now using the most powerful draw tools available in the Standard card pool in :Card{name="Rashida Jaheem"} and :Card{name="Violet Level Clearance"}. With these, you will very quickly find everything you're looking for. 

Additionally, you have :Card{name="Cyberdex Virus Suite"} to throw a wrench into the Runners plans. They will have to respect your :Card{name="Hagen"} and :Card{name="Drafter"} now and slow down to find their tools.

Finally, you now have access to :Card{name="Ikawah Project"}, which in combination with :Card{name="Manegarm Skunkworks"} and :Card{name="Border Control"} can become very hard to steal for the Runner.

Try to go fast and overwhelm the Runner with your tempo! Good luck!

#R3
Here we are at the final station of the full [Hivemind MaxX](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/64846/hivemind-maxx-1st-4th-6th-7th-10th-14th-at-early-bird-) list, that we unleashed at one of the first big tournaments in the Gateway meta.

This list is very tricky to play, since it is quite fragile, but can be extremely powerful, when played correctly. The basic idea of the Hoshiko list is still there, but turned up to 11. :Card{name="MaxX"} allows you to very quickly see a lot of your cards, even though most of them will end up in the heap instead. Thankfully :Card{name="Simulchip"} will fetch them for you so the downside gets mitigated.

A new addition to the virus suite is :Card{name="Progenitor"}, which does two things for you: It eliminates the MU cost of your virusses and helps you be a bit more resilient against purges. This will prove very useful to host :Card{name="Hivemind"}. This card had a bad reputation for being a very janky card for a long while, but has found its home in this deck. It comes with one virus token (two with :Card{name="Cookbook"}) and tokens on this card are treated as if they were on _all_ of your virusses, which amplifies their power significantly.

Together with :Card{name="Knobkierie"} to put tokens on your Hivemind, you will very quickly have an extremely powerful suite of virusses at your disposal. When using :Card{name="Fermenter"}, you only lose the tokens on the card, but count those on Hivemind as well, easily gaining you 10+ credits. Your :Card{name="Chisel"} becomes a nightmare for the Corp, chewing through ice even without the need for :Card{name="Devil Charm"}. Also :Card{name="Conduit"} now starts digging for a lot of cards from the get go!

If that's still not enough, take a look at :Card{name="Tranquilizer"}. With a :Card{name="Cookbook"} out, a single token on Hivemind is enough for this to come on the board with 3 tokens already. If you take a closer look at the timing chart, this allows for some very powerful shenanigans. Installing the Tranquilizer with :Card{name="Simulchip"} in the paid ability window during the ice encounter means the ice gets instantly derezzed. Since you're already past the point, where the Corp is allowed to rez ice, this means you have completely circumvented dealing with the ice entirely!

Your breakers have almost completely disappeared. :Card{name="MKUltra"} and :Card{name="Paperclip"} deal with some problematic ice the Corp could be throwing at you, but your most consistent breaker is :Card{name="Aumakua"}. With a Hivemind, this breaker easily reaches the necessary strength for almost any piece of ice in the Corp's arsenal.

And as if that's not enough, the deck unleashes its full potential, once it runs out of cards! Once you're down to 0 cards in stack, use :Card{name="Labor Rights"} to grab back the three most useful cards (typically including another copy of Labor Rights) and instantly draw one of them. If you then use :Card{name="Rebirth"} to switch away from MaxX (mostly to :Card{name="Omar Keung"}), you will have quick access to the most powerful tools in your list, that were previously milled by MaxX triggers.

This is a lot to take in and it will take time to get used to the variety of options presented to you, but once mastered, this list overcomes its fragility and becomes a very powerful setup!
